                    <h3><p>I have worked in and around computers ever since I first gained a part time job at the age of 18. It is through my academic studies and surrounding myself in the industry, that I have been able to develop both strong theoretical knowledge and the ability to apply this knowledge. These learnings have helped me to develop skills in both time management and quality control, two skills in which I pride myself on. In this time, I have also developed strong leadership skills from both the training of junior staff and through the opportunity to lead a group of IT Undergraduate Students as a Student Mentor.</p>
					
					 <p>I am a very enthusiastic individual with high interpersonal skills and people management. I enjoy spending time with my wife and children. I am a very fit person and also pride myself on my personal dress and bearing. Over the past 18 years I have experienced many industries but most notably was my career with the Royal Australian Navy.</p>
